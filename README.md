Hi, Noal here.
<br><br><br>
📍 Originally from a very small island in Canada, but I live in Austria at the moment (its a long story) <br>

👨‍💻 Building Vue frontends with Echosec Systems since 2019 <br>

🌱 Currently learning React through my [side project](https://www.instantlessonplan.com/) (still in beta) <br>

🏔 I try to get outside as much as possible to offset all the screen hours<br>
  
💭 Prefer to skip the smalltalk and go straight to the deep stuff
